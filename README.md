# Traffic-Sign-Classifier-P2

### Overview

This is the project submission for Udacity's Self Driving Car Nano Degree: **'*Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program*'**.

In this project, we will use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. We will train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, we will then test our model program on new images of traffic signs from the web.

The implementation uses **TensorFlow**.

The full solution is provided in the [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) notebook.
